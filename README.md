# Cross-Referenced Israeli Streets and Statistical Areas

This project provides a spatial dataset that cross-references **streets** and **statistical areas** in Israel. The dataset was created using publicly available data from the **Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)** and **OpenStreetMap**, and processed using **QGIS**. It can support spatial analysis, urban planning, and socio-economic research.
